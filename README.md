1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met?  
Timely delivery keeps customers happy and saves money. Project managers can meet deadlines by planning well, setting clear goals, tracking progress, and adjusting when needed.


2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?  
Cost control helps a project stay within budget. It avoids wasting money. Strategies include setting a clear budget, monitoring expenses often, and avoiding unnecessary features.


3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?**  
Agile: flexible, allows changes, works in small steps — good for ongoing feedback.  
Waterfall: follows a fixed plan, easy to manage — but hard to change once started.  
Agile = fast and flexible; Waterfall = structured and predictable.


4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?  
Agile: best for new or changing projects (e.g., a mobile app startup).  
Waterfall: better for fixed-scope projects (e.g., government software systems).


5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods: regular testing, code reviews, feedback, and fixing bugs early.  
High standards avoid problems, keep users happy, and reduce costs later.


6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?**  
Defining scope sets clear goals and limits. A WBS breaks big tasks into smaller ones. It helps teams stay organized and focused.


7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?**  
A schedule shows what to do and when. Gantt charts show tasks and deadlines visually. They help teams manage time and avoid delays.


8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience? 
Your software should solve a real problem your users face. If the issue is common and painful, users will care and want your solution.


9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution? 
Clear problems lead to clear solutions. Knowing the exact need helps you build software that actually helps the user.


10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?  
Describe what it does, who it helps, and how it makes life easier. Example: “It’s a tool that helps students manage their assignments and deadlines more easily.”



11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?  
Focus on what’s different and helpful — like speed, ease of use, special tools, or smart features that solve problems better than others.

12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software? 
Look for stats on how many people have the problem you're solving, how much they spend, and if the market is growing each year.


13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?  
Trends show what users want. If you follow trends, you can build software that fits user needs and stands out in the market.
